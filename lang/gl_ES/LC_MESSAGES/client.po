"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. They "

"Lichess enables the online, real-time, and competitive aspects of game-play."

msgstr ""
"Máis tarde, desenvolvedores achegados ao proxecto Lichess deron en estender "
"Stockfish a Multivariant-Stockfish, para soportar Crazyhouse e compañía. O "

"traballando nese fork, e máis tarde deu varios pasos máis en termos de "
"soporte de variantes e estensibilidade. Polo tanto Fairy-Stockfish naceu tan"
