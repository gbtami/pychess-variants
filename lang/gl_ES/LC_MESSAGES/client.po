"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. They "

"computing power they've managed to harness."

"\"Para min, o feito de estar hoxe aquí debémosllo nunha GRANDE parte a "

"Lichess enables the online, real-time, and competitive aspects of game-play."

"Lichess ofrece xogar de forma competitiva, en tempo real e online. Tamén "

"variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was born, so "
"powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project."
msgstr ""
"Máis tarde, desenvolvedores achegados ao proxecto Lichess deron en estender "
"Stockfish a Multivariant-Stockfish, para soportar Crazyhouse e compañía. O "
"pai de Fairy-Stockfish, Fabian, tamén é un deses desenvolvedores (todavía) "
"traballando nese fork, e máis tarde deu varios pasos máis en termos de "
"soporte de variantes e estensibilidade. Polo tanto Fairy-Stockfish naceu tan"
