"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. "
"They rallied global volunteers to come together in the open-source spirit"
" and create such a powerful engine for FREE. That's a lot of great minds "
"and computing power they've managed to harness."

"Then we've got Lichess to thank. Lichess was also born out of the same "
"open-source spirit, and it too drew in great people as well. Once Lichess"

"Lichess enables the online, real-time, and competitive aspects of game-"
"play. They also bring the enormous power of Stockfish to the masses, who "
"can now benefit from it without configuring a local GUI. I believe this "
"development turns out to be of great consequence and significance."

#: ../client/about.ts:11
msgid ""
"Later on, developers close to the Lichess project eventually extended "
"Stockfish into Multivariant-Stockfish, in order to support Crazyhouse et "
"al. The father of Fairy-Stockfish, Fabian, is also one of those devs "
"(still) working on that fork, and he later took several steps further in "
"terms of variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was "
"born, so powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project."

"Then comes our beloved pychess-variants, which again very smartly "
"harnesses the underlying superpowers of the big projects. Same online, "
