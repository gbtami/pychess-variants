"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. "
"They rallied global volunteers to come together in the open-source spirit"
" and create such a powerful engine for FREE. That's a lot of great minds "

"Lichess enables the online, real-time, and competitive aspects of game-"

"Later on, developers close to the Lichess project eventually extended "
"Stockfish into Multivariant-Stockfish, in order to support Crazyhouse et "
"al. The father of Fairy-Stockfish, Fabian, is also one of those devs "
"(still) working on that fork, and he later took several steps further in "
"terms of variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was "
"born, so powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project."

"harnesses the underlying superpowers of the big projects. Same online, "
