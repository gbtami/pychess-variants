"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. They "
"rallied global volunteers to come together in the open-source spirit and "

"computing power they've managed to harness."

"variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was born, so "
"powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project."
