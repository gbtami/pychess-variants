"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. They "
"rallied global volunteers to come together in the open-source spirit and "
"create such a powerful engine for FREE. That's a lot of great minds and "
"computing power they've managed to harness."
msgstr ""
"\"저에게는, 오늘 우리가 여기까지 올 수 있었던 것은 대규모의 Stockfish 덕분입니다. 그들은 오픈 소스 정신의 글로벌 자원 "
"봉사자들을 모아 무료로 강력한 엔진을 만들었습니다. 그것은 그들이 활용할 수 있었던 많은 위대한 정신과 컴퓨팅 능력입니다."

"Then we've got Lichess to thank. Lichess was also born out of the same open-"
"source spirit, and it too drew in great people as well. Once Lichess "
"incorporated Stockfish as its brains, the rest is history."
msgstr ""
"그러고나서 우리는 고맙게도 Lichess를 얻게 되었습니다. Lichess 또한 동일한 오픈 소스 정신에서 생겨 났으며 훌륭한 사람들도 "

msgid ""
"Lichess enables the online, real-time, and competitive aspects of game-play."
" They also bring the enormous power of Stockfish to the masses, who can now "

"turns out to be of great consequence and significance."
msgstr ""
"Lichess는 온라인, 실시간, 경쟁 게임플레이를 가능하게 했습니다. 그것은  또한 Stockfish의 엄청난 힘을 사용자에게 가져다 "
"주며, 사용자들은 이제 로컬 GUI를 구성하지 않고도 혜택을 누릴 수 있습니다."

#: ../client/about.ts:13
msgid ""
"Later on, developers close to the Lichess project eventually extended "
"Stockfish into Multivariant-Stockfish, in order to support Crazyhouse et al."
" The father of Fairy-Stockfish, Fabian, is also one of those devs (still) "
"working on that fork, and he later took several steps further in terms of "
"variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was born, so "
"powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project."
msgstr ""
"나중에, Lichess 프로젝트에 가까운 개발자는 Crazyhouse 등을 지원하기 위해 Stockfish를 Multivariant-"
"Stockfish로 확장했습니다. Fairy-Stockfish의 아버지 인 Fabian도 해당 버젼을 작업하는 개발자 중 한 명이며 "
"나중에 다른 지원 및 확장성 측면에서 그는 몇 단계 더 나아갔습니다. 따라서 Fairy-Stockfish는 Stockfish 프로젝트를 "
"기반으로 구축 되었기 때문에 매우 강력했습니다."

"Then comes our beloved pychess-variants, which again very smartly harnesses "

"그런 다음 큰 프로젝트의 기초가 되는 능력을 매우 현명하게 다시 활용한 우리가 애용하는 pychess변형판이 나옵니다. 온라인, 실시간,"
