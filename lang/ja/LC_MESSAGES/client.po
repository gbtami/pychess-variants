"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. They "
"rallied global volunteers to come together in the open-source spirit and "
"create such a powerful engine for FREE. That's a lot of great minds and "
"computing power they've managed to harness."

"Later on, developers close to the Lichess project eventually extended "
"Stockfish into Multivariant-Stockfish, in order to support Crazyhouse et al."
" The father of Fairy-Stockfish, Fabian, is also one of those devs (still) "
"working on that fork, and he later took several steps further in terms of "
"variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was born, so "
"powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project."
