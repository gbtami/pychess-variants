<p>Each variant also has its own selection of piece sets and boards to choose from! Especially for the Asian variants that use Chinese characters, you can find internationalized pieces for those variants to use as well. To change the settings, click the gear button in the game replay box on the right. You can also scale the board size using the slider here.</p>
