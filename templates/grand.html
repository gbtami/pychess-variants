<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Grand Chess was created by Christian Freeling in 1984 and is one of the highest regarded chess variants according to the Chess Variants site.  </p>
<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<p>The game is played on a 10 x 10 board, with additional files for the new Marshal (Knight/Rook)  and Cardinal (Knight/Bishop), which are both placed on the king side. Because of the larger board size, most of the starting pieces are moved up one rank, with the exception of the rooks which remain in the last ranks.</p>
<p>In addition to the pieces and setup, there are three other significant differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pawns can promote when reaching the eighth or ninth rank. Promotion must happen upon reaching the 10th rank. If not possible (see next point), then the pawn can’t move.</li>
<li>Pawns can only promote to pieces of the same color that have been lost.</li>
<li>There is no castling.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Please note that despite the names of Marshal and Cardinal, the notation used here uses A and C for both of those, respectively (as in Capablanca chess), so that the PGN is compatible with other chess variant software.)</p>
<h2 id="new-pieces">New Pieces</h2>
<h3 id="cardinal">Cardinal</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.pychess.org/static/images/CVariantsGuide/Princesses.png" alt="Cardinal" /></p>
<p>Various symbols used for the cardinal. (Note that the hawk is only for Seiwaran Chess)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pychess.org/static/images/CVariantsGuide/Archbishop.png" alt="Cardinal moves" /></p>
<p>The cardinal (A in Pychess, for archbishop) is a compound piece combining the moves of the <strong>bishop</strong> and <strong>knight</strong>. In terms of fairy pieces, this is generically known as the princess, but also has other names in different variants.</p>
<p>The piece is often symbolized with a combination of a knight and bishop; most variants often do not specify how the piece should look otherwise (which is why we offer different piece sets to choose from).</p>
<p>The cardinal is unique in that it is the only piece that can checkmate on its own, which you may be able to appreciate if you look at its movement/attack pattern.</p>
<p>The value of a cardinal is considered slightly better than a rook, but less than the elephant and queen.</p>
<h3 id="marshal">Marshal</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.pychess.org/static/images/CVariantsGuide/Empresses.png" alt="Marshal" /></p>
<p>Various symbols used for the marshal. (Note that the hawk is only for Seiwaran Chess)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pychess.org/static/images/CVariantsGuide/Chancellor.png" alt="Marshal moves" /></p>
<p>The marshal (C in Pychess, for chancellor) is a compound piece combining the moves of the <strong>rook</strong> and the <strong>knight</strong>. In terms of fairy pieces, this is generically known as the empress, but also has other names in different variants. </p>
<p>The piece is often symbolized with a combination of a knight and rook; most variants often do not specify how the piece should look otherwise (which is why we offer different piece sets to choose from).</p>
<p>The value of a marshal is considered better than a cardinal, but equivalent or slightly less than a queen.</p>
<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>
<p>One should not simply make just developing moves. You can afford to lag in development so long as you are working on controling key squares. Quality over quantity.</p>
