<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Capahouse 960 is a custom variant combining the rules of Capablanca chess, Crazyhouse, and Chess 960. The same rules apply to both games. As this is considered a derivative of Capablanca chess, please check the Capablanca rules in its separate guide. Crazyhouse and 960 rules are as below for a reminder.</p>
<p>This variant can be played by checking the "Chess960" option when creating a Capahouse game.</p>
<h2 id="crazyhouse-rules">Crazyhouse Rules</h2>
<p>Drops can be performed with captured pieces, which would be done in lieu of moving a piece on the board. Drops are annotated with @. So for example,R@e4 means rook drop at e4. The rules for dropping pieces are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drops resulting in immediate checkmate are permitted. Unlike in shogi, this includes pawn drops.</li>
<li>Pawns may not be dropped on the players' 1st or 8th ranks.</li>
<li>Pawns that have been promoted and later captured are dropped as pawns.</li>
<li>Dropped white and black pawns on the 2nd and 7th ranks, respectively, are permitted to make a two-square move as their first move after the drop.</li>
<li>A dropped rook can't castle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="960-rules">960 Rules</h2>
<p>The starting bottom ranks are randomized, but two rules must be followed:</p>
<p>The bishops must be placed on opposite-color squares.<br />
The king must be placed on a square between the rooks.<br />
Castling is the other major rule to take note of. Basically, regardless of where the rooks are, if you castle, the end position will be the same as if the rooks were in standard position.</p>

<p>A king may not castle with a dropped rook.</p>
