// TODO: This files contains types related almost entirely only to web socket messages, and ONLY those that are used in more than one different places (.ts files)
//       Other such (message) types which are specific only to single file/page and never re-used in multiple places exist in their corresponding files.
//       Would be good to review the types here and those other types in each specific file (e.g. roundCtrl.ts, analysisCtrl.ts, editorCtrl.ts, tournament.ts, lobby.ts)
//       and see if there is any duplication or the ones that are here should be split or any other improvement that might be needed or better organization can be found
