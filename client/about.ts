"\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. They rallied global volunteers to come together in the open-source spirit and create such a powerful engine for FREE. That's a lot of great minds and computing power they've managed to harness.",
"Then we've got Lichess to thank. Lichess was also born out of the same open-source spirit, and it too drew in great people as well. Once Lichess incorporated Stockfish as its brains, the rest is history.",
"Lichess enables the online, real-time, and competitive aspects of game-play. They also bring the enormous power of Stockfish to the masses, who can now benefit from it without configuring a local GUI. I believe this development turns out to be of great consequence and significance.",
"Later on, developers close to the Lichess project eventually extended Stockfish into Multivariant-Stockfish, in order to support Crazyhouse et al. The father of Fairy-Stockfish, Fabian, is also one of those devs (still) working on that fork, and he later took several steps further in terms of variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was born, so powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project.",
"Then comes our beloved pychess-variants, which again very smartly harnesses the underlying superpowers of the big projects. Same online, real-time, and competitive aspects. Same clean and familiar Lichess look and feel. Plus the power of Stockfish!\"",
