        // box, which was the only reason `main.round.bug` needed a grid at all — two children to
        // place instead of one. It also announced an empty `complementary` landmark to anyone
        // navigating by landmark, which is worse than free. The app is the wrapper's only child
        // now, on both pages, and the wrapper is the `<main>`.

        // cost. But it was never a cost this markup was paying: nothing was ever drawn in it, so
        // building one is a feature, not the restoration of something these lines provided.
