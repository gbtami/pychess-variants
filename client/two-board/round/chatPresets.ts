// The bughouse chat presets: the grid of "need a knight", "don't trade", "my bad"
// buttons a player uses to tell their partner something without typing it.
//
// This used to be rendered from inside `client/chat.ts`, the chat view shared by
// every page, which imported this module and branched on whether the controller
// was a bughouse round controller. A shared view reaching into one page's module
// to decide what to draw. Nothing about these buttons belongs to chat except that
// clicking one sends a message.
//
// A widget in the house shape — one composed view, built once — so the page can
// put it wherever a layout wants it, rather than wherever the chat view's own
// flex box happens to put it.
//
// TWO-STEP INITIALISATION, and it is a real ordering constraint rather than an
// awkwardness to design around. Everything these buttons LOOK like comes from the
// variant: the pocket roles decide which pieces get a "need" and a "don't give"
// pair, and the tells are fixed. So they are built in the constructor. But
// clicking one has to send, and only the round controller can send — and the
// controller is constructed in the round app's `insert` hook, which runs after
// the view it is being inserted into has been built. The widget therefore cannot
// have a sender when it renders, and is given one afterwards by `wire()`.
//
// Between the page's patch and that call, a click does nothing at all. That gap
// is a few milliseconds inside the same task in which the page becomes visible,
// so queueing a click for later delivery would be machinery for a case that
// cannot occur — but discarding is a decision, not an oversight.
export class ChatPresetsView {
    // TWO PARTS, each holding TWO SETS of five buttons.
    //
    // The four sets are the four rows the single grid always drew: what to ask
    // for, what not to give, and the tells in two halves. Splitting them lets the
    // layout place each part where there is room for it, one at a time, instead of
    // moving all twenty buttons or none.
    //
    // The two sets inside a part are laid out so they sit side by side when the
    // part is wide enough for both and stack when it is not — so a part that has
    // dropped into the width under the board shows its ten buttons on one row,
    // and the same part beside the board shows them as two rows of five, which is
    // what they have always looked like. Nothing forces the fit: the wrap decides,
    // so there is no width that has to be computed and kept true.
    //
    // A set is never broken up. Five buttons on one row is the unit, because the
    // ask/don't-give pair is piece-aligned — column i is piece i, so "need a
    // knight" sits above "don't give a knight" whenever the two sets are stacked.
