/* THE ALTERNATING LADDER.
   One engine, two positions. Both boards are searched to the SAME target depth, then the target
   rises by a step and both are searched again — so neither board is ever far ahead of the other,
   and each visit starts from a hash that already holds its own previous search.

   `go` always restarts iterative deepening at depth 1, so nothing is literally resumed. What
   carries across a visit is the transposition table, which survives every `position` / `go`
   because this file never sends `ucinewgame` or `Clear Hash` — and must not start.

   A SLICE IS ONE PLY, NOT A STRETCH OF TIME. Each visit asks a board for exactly one depth more
   than it has already reached, and hands the engine over the moment that depth arrives. So the two
   boards advance in lockstep by the thing a reader actually compares — depth — and nothing here
   depends on a millisecond constant nobody measured.

   The earlier design sliced by time (`go depth N movetime 4000`) on the reasoning that two
   positions of unequal difficulty would otherwise spend wildly unequal wall-clock on a turn. They
   still do; that asymmetry belongs to the positions and a timer only hides it. What the timer
   actually produced, measured on `JJgZzLhJ`: board B never reached the shared target at all, so its
   rung kept rising underneath it — the target advanced on every wrap whether or not the board had
   achieved the previous one — and B re-searched an unreachable depth for ever at 10-12 while
   claiming to be climbing. A ladder that raises the rung a board did not reach is not a ladder.

   THE TARGET IS NOW PER BOARD and is simply "one more than you have": there is no shared rung to
   get out of step with a board's actual progress. BASE is only where a board's first visit starts,
   low enough to be quick and high enough not to waste visits on depths nobody reads.

   A slice that ends BELOW its target ended for a reason the engine chose — a forced mate, no legal
   moves — not because a clock ran out, so that board is finished and is not visited again. */

/* BORROWED DROPS, and why they have to be rendered at all.
   Fairy-Stockfish searches drops of pieces a side does not hold yet, because in bughouse they
   arrive from the partner's board — a queen nobody holds now may well be in hand three plies from
   now. `ffish` judges legality against the pocket the FEN records and refuses, and `variationSan`
   is all-or-nothing: one such drop at ply 3 returned "" for the WHOLE line, which the panel then
   skipped, leaving the row on its placeholder or on a stale variation from an earlier depth.

   Measured on board A of `JJgZzLhJ`, pocket `[Bp]`: `P@f7 B@h5 Q@e5 e1d1` converted to "" because
   after the first two drops both pockets are empty and Black has no queen. Its first two plies
   convert perfectly well.

   So the line is walked a ply at a time, and a piece the mover does not hold is LENT to them for
   the length of the conversion — the board is a throwaway used for notation, never the position
   the engine or the page reasons about. The lent plies are marked so the reader can see which
   part of the line is a promise about the partner rather than a fact about this board. */
