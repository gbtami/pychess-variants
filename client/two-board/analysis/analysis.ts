    /* THE TOOLS COLUMN, as a tabbed panel beside the boards.
       Three tabs, and the grouping is the decision worth stating:

       MOVES holds the movelist, the move controls AND the whole engine — its switches,
       its name panel, its principal variation and #misc-info. They are one activity,
       reading the game, and splitting the evaluation from the move it evaluates would
       make a reader choose which half to look at.

       IT IS ONE TAB IN THREE PARTS, and the two statements do not conflict. A PART is the
       smallest thing this page can PLACE — a named grid area holds one item, so a single
       panel can only ever be in one place at a time. Selecting a tab shows every one of its
       parts, so the reader still has the evaluation beside the move it evaluates however the
       parts are arranged; what the split buys is that the engine box and the button row can
       go somewhere the movelist cannot follow. Both are content-height and read at a glance,
       which is what zone A — the band the shorter board frees, measured empty at 701x829 — has
       room for. The rule for when they actually go there is a separate change; this one only
       makes them separable.

       INFO is the game information that used to sit bottom-left.

       CHAT is #roundchat, which is in this page's markup and renders nowhere visible.
       It is given a tab so it becomes observable and can then be judged — not because
       its home is decided. Deleting it would settle its fate without anyone ever having
       seen it. */
    /* ONE TABBED PANEL FOR THE WHOLE PAGE.
       There used to be two: this one beside the boards, and a second under them holding the move
       chart and FEN & PGN. Two switchers meant two places to look for a thing that is not on
       screen, and the lower one cost the page a full-width row of its own — which is what put the
       chart below the fold in every mode. Merged, the page has one place where everything that is
       not a board lives.

       The tabs are declared as data rather than inline, because the page mounts one panel per tab
       and that list has to follow the declarations. It used to mount `panel(0,0)`, `panel(1,0)`,
       `panel(2,0)` by hand, which was already wrong for the blank analysis board: that build
       declares only ONE tab, and `panel(1, 0)` on a one-tab widget is an index error. */

                   the DROP QUEUE's, not a matter of reading pleasure. Zone A grows upwards from
                   the bottom row of the strip, so a part's row is its place in the queue: the
                   first to leave must be in the last row and whatever never leaves must be in the
                   first. The move list never leaves — it is the one part useless in a band four
                   squares tall — so it holds row 1; the engine box leaves before the controls,
                   being the taller of the two, so it sits below them. See the `zoneTools` rules in
                   `bughouse.css` and the droppable list in `analysisCtrl.ts`.

                   Each boundary is drawn where the thing behind it is one whole:

                   The ENGINE is its switch, both boards' numbers, its name, both PV columns and
                   the Multiple-lines control that decides how many lines there are. The control
                   belongs with the lines it counts, which is why the pv box comes with it rather
                   than staying with the movelist.

                   The RECORD is the movelist block and #misc-info, which is the movelist's own
                   footer on the single-board page and empty on this one.

                   The CONTROLS are the six buttons: flip, switch, start, back, forward, end.
                   They act on the position, not on the list, and they are the one part here whose
                   whole content is a row — 100.8px wide and 40px tall, which is why a narrow band
                   can take them. */

               lives, and the selector was the last thing outside it. Sitting in the app's
               grid instead, it had no area of its own: the templates here name
               `ownstack stack zoneTools1/2 zoneA zoneB` and nothing else, so `gameinfo`
               and `uleft` were UNKNOWN names and grid put each in an implicit track of its
               own. On a real game both elements are empty and those tracks measure 0px,
               which is why this went unseen; on the blank board the selector gave one of
               them a size and it took 261.6px of column and 82.7px of row away from the

                   block flow. The consequence was not a stack laid out differently; it was a stack
                   with NO DEFINITE WIDTH. `.cg-wrap` resolves its height from percentage padding
                   against its own width, so board B stopped following `--bug-sq-b` and instead took
                   whatever its grid area gave it — the app's `auto` track, whose base is the seat
                   strip's max-content. Measured at 1276x430: columns 354.6 / 225.1 / 679.1 with
                   board A at 341 and board B at 225, the partner's gauge 225 wide and ZERO tall in
                   block flow, and the partner's pockets 213 (5 squares, sized from the variable as
                   intended) beside a 225 board. Flipping this one value: 354.6 / 354.6 / 549.6,
                   both boards 341, the gauge back in the board's row — and the tools still 550 wide.
                   The partner board being smaller than the viewer's own is a DECISION this page has
                   yet to take; it was not this. */

                   over, which measurement confirmed this page already has: the analysis
                   clocks are absolutely positioned overlays on the board and add no height.

                   The stacks carry the round page's own class names deliberately. That is
                   what lets `isOutsidePartnerStack()` answer here unchanged, and what makes
                   the coordinate machinery keyed to `.bug-own-stack, .bug-partner-stack`
                   apply without a second copy.

                   WHICH board goes in which stack is decided by seats — see
                   `ownBoardName()` — so a player always finds their own board in the main

                   so a sibling spans all three and the gauge ran the pocket's height taller
                   at each end. Inside the stack it occupies the BOARD's row and stretches
                   to exactly the board's height — by construction, with no arithmetic and

                       board's tab is index 0 and mounted above, so the slice starts at 1 and the
                       widget is asked for `t + 1`.
                       Every tab but the board's: that one is mounted above, in the column, which is
                       the whole point of a detached tab — the widget says whether a part is shown,
                       never where.

                       A TAB OF SEVERAL PARTS IS MOUNTED AS ONE GROUP, and the group is the grid
                       item its single panel used to be. Two items assigned the same named area do
                       not stack, they OVERLAP, so parts that still share a home have to be one
                       item — and the group takes the area the panel took in every home this page
                       has, which is why declaring the parts moves nothing on screen.

                       The element is the PAGE'S, not the widget's: the widget builds no container
                       around a tab's parts, deliberately, because that container is exactly what a
                       mode wanting one part elsewhere has to dissolve. The round page's
                       `.bug-presets-group` is the same element with its default the other way
                       round — dissolved everywhere, a box only in zone B, where two preset rows
                       must be one item to span both boards. Here the box is the default because
                       all three parts are still in the column together; the mode that relocates
                       one of them is what will dissolve it. */
