// Reusable ARIA tablist/tabpanel widget for two-board pages.
//
// The widget builds mountable vnodes and nothing else: the **tablist**, and one
// **panel** per part of per tab. It deliberately does NOT build a container
// around any of them — not around the tablist and the panels, not around one
// tab's several parts, and not around the same part index across tabs. A page
// that wants any of them inside one element renders that element itself, which
// is what lets a page put the switcher somewhere other than directly above its
// content, and put one part of a tab somewhere other than beside its siblings.
//
// A tab is a list of PARTS. Each part is one dom-tree, mounted wherever the page
// wants it, and every part of every tab is an independent mount point: three tabs
// of two parts each give six. Part counts are per tab and unrelated — one tab may
// have three parts, the next one, the next two. Nothing is derived from a maximum
// and nothing is reserved for a part that was not declared.
//
// Parts are addressed positionally, by `panel(tabIndex, partIndex)`. The caller
// declared the tabs in order and each tab's parts in order, so it can name any
// part in the same terms it used to build it. A caller may equally keep the
// vnodes it passed in and mount those instead; both work. Note the accessor
// returns the panel this module wrapped around that content, not the content
// itself — the wrapper carries the ARIA attributes and the visibility that
// switching toggles, so the wrapper is the thing to mount.
//
// That freedom is real because switching never touches the DOM: `select()`
// addresses the tab and panel vnodes this object retains, through their `.elm`.
// There is no proximity requirement between any two parts, and no selector, id
// lookup or traversal anywhere in this module. Ids exist on the elements only
// because `aria-controls` and `aria-labelledby` are id references, and no
// behaviour here reads them. A tab controls several panels once it has several
// parts, which `aria-controls` expresses natively as an id-reference list.
//
// Callers never name a tab or a panel. The constructor id is a prefix:
// `<id>-tablist` for the tablist, `<id>-tab-<i>` for a tab and
// `<id>-panel-<tab>-<part>` for a panel, so two widgets on one page cannot
// collide.
//
// SIZING IS THE PAGE'S JOB. Because there is no panel container, nothing here
// claims space or passes it on; each panel is sized by wherever it is mounted.
// The round page's stylesheet does this for its panels, and any layout that
// mounts a part somewhere new has to say what that part does there.
//
// Selection is NOT a re-render. Re-patching would be the more idiomatic snabbdom
// approach, but panels hold content this module does not own — the round page's
// movelist and game-info views retain and patch their own vnodes, and its chat
// renders into its container after insertion. Diffing those subtrees can replace
// the very elements those owners hold, leaving them patching detached nodes, so
// their content would silently stop updating. Toggling element state leaves
// every panel's subtree untouched.
//
// The consequence is that the selected tab lives in the DOM rather than in a
// model: anything that re-patches a mounted part resets it to index 0. No
// two-board page does that — each owner patches inside a panel.
