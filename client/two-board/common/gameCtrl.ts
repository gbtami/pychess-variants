    /* A REASON TO REFUSE MOVES THAT IS NOT ABOUT THE POSITION.
     *
     * `setDests()` in the base class answers "what does the variant allow here", computed from the
     * position alone. A bughouse board sometimes has to refuse a move for a reason the position
     * cannot express: that a move of ours is outstanding and a second one would race it — branch
     * 1.2.3 of the reconnect tree.
     *
     * OVERRIDDEN HERE RATHER THAN ADDED TO THE BASE, because it is a bughouse concept. Every
     * single-board game and the analysis page keep exactly the `setDests()` they had.
     *
     * ASKED, NOT STORED. A copy of the answer kept on this object would be a third place the same
     * fact lives — beside the records the reconnect controller holds and the map chessground holds
     * — and every one of those needs a moment where somebody remembers to update it. That is the
     * exact shape of the bug this replaces: the gate used to be applied by BLANKING the map after
     * the fact, at one of the four places that write it, and the other three recomputed it and
     * silently gave the board back. A predicate has no such moment — it is evaluated when the
     * answer is needed, so it cannot be stale.
     *
     * The mirror of `snapshot(history, playableNow)`, where the controller borrows a board it does
     * not have. Here a board borrows a controller it does not have. Defaults to allowing
     * everything, so a board nobody wires behaves exactly as before.
     *
     * A PROTOTYPE METHOD, NOT A CLASS FIELD, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS LOAD-BEARING. `GameController`'s
     * constructor calls `this.setDests()`, which dispatches to the override below — and a subclass
     * class field is not initialised until `super()` RETURNS, so a field here would still be
     * `undefined` at that call and every board would die building itself. A prototype method exists
     * before any constructor body runs. `roundCtrl` still assigns over it; that makes an own
     * property which shadows this, which is exactly what is wanted. */
