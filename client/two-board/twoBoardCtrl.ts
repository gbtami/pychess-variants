 * Forget both boards' memoised rects, so the next read measures the page as it now is.
 *
 * chessgroundx maps every click through a memoised `getBoundingClientRect()` and refreshes it on
 * exactly two signals: its own `ResizeObserver`, which fires when a board CHANGES SIZE, and
 * `window.resize` / `scroll`, which clear the memo. A board that MOVES without resizing sends
 * neither — and this layout moves boards for reasons of its own: zooming the other column
 * narrows the first grid track, a username takes a line of its own and pushes the board down
 * inside its stack, a tools part drops into a zone and the rows shift. Measured on a live game:
 * board B sitting at y=80.7 against a memo saying 100.3, a 19.6px error on a 20.7px square, and a
 * right-click one square below the top edge produced no shape at all because the pixel mapped
 * outside the board chessground believed in.
 *
 * CLEARING, NOT RE-MEASURING, and that is what makes this safe. It writes nothing, touches no
 * element and cannot wake an observer, so it starts no cascade — where `updateBounds()` sets the
 * container's size and could. It also needs no ordering: the rect is recomputed at the next READ,
 * which is the click, by which time the arrangement has certainly settled. An attempt to measure
 * on the next frame instead had to guess when the placement passes were done, and could memoise
 * the very geometry it was trying to replace.
