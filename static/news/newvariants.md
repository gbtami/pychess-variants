**New Variants**

Many New variants are available! The rules are very similar to lichess, the most obvious change being the must capture. How the rules of lichess variants differ from liantichess variants is very briefly described [here](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/variants).

Currently other variants are planned on discord. If you are familiar with these variants and want to help, please look at the corresponding issues on github. If you want to request a variant, you believe would be reasonably popular, you can create a new issue on github. Just keep in mind that our main focus will remain on antichess, so all variants other than losing will not get implemented.

**Analysis And Fairy Stockfish**

Liantichess now supports Analysis for Antichess and Antichess/Coffee Variants. Do feel free to analyse any game on Liantichess now.

Do note that Liantichess uses a fork of fairyfishnet (https://github.com/gbtami/fairyfishnet) which you can find here https://github.com/TheYoBots/fairyfishnet . So only as long as someone is running it analysis in Liantichess will work.
