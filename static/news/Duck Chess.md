In response to the recent popularity of Duck Chess, we've decided to add it to Pychess as well. If you're not familiar with this interesting variant, here's a nice introductory video by <a href="/@/EricRosen">Eric Rosen</a>.

Also we've added Duck Chess to our tournament schedule on the 27th of each month. The introductory arena will happen on 27 Dec 2022, 16:00 UTC... We'll be more than happy if you join!

Also special thanks to <a href="/@/ubdip">@ubdip</a> for adding the duck rule to Fairy-Stockfish and consequently making this possible!

Also, Happy New year!

Also quack. ðŸ¦†
