## About
Repository for shogi pieces I made or modified. By default the filenames are for [XBoard](https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/) and [gshogi](https://github.com/johncheetham/gshogi), but of course they can be used with other programs, too. The files were made with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org). This repository also contains board tiles (see screenshots), which were made/modified with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org).

### International

A modified version of [CouchTomato87](https://github.com/CouchTomato87/InternationalizedPieces/tree/master/Shogi)'s and [Hidetchi](https://github.com/Hidetchi)'s pieces. I made the hisha piece into a winged (flying) chariot that also looks like a rook. :) I also changed the bishop to a modified Hidetchi version, change/modified the lance, and made new king and jeweled pieces (the jeweled has a little jewel in the crown).

### Doubutsu

I recreated all of the original [Doubutsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dbutsu_sh%C5%8Dgi) pieces in Inkscape SVG format.

(also: [screenshot of the gshogi version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ka-hu/shogi-pieces/master/_screenshots/scrot_doubutsu_gshogi.png))

### Military

A new, self-made piece set. The moves are not changed of course, it's still "normal" shogi, only the pictures are different. When a piece got promoted it gets a red rank above its picture, except the tank (rook) which becomes a drone tank, and the aircraft (bishop) which becomes a drone.
