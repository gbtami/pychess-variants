The [Shogi Harbour Discord server](https://discord.gg/uxfjFfe) recently finished its first xiangqi league! For those unfamiliar, this was created by fellow member [@DrLennon](https://www.pychess.org/@/DrLennon); participants played a group round and were sorted into a Red League (higher ranks) and Black League (lower ranks). After the league games were played, players were seeded into a single elimination tournament. You can see the bracket above, and list of games below. Congrats to [@Illion](https://www.pychess.org/@/Illion), who ended up winning it all!

The group round results were as follows:
