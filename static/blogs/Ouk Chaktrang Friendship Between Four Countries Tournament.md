Hello everyone,

During the past few months, a tournament involving top players from four Southeast Asian countries was held on PyChess. The variant of choice was Ouk Chaktrang. This round-robin tournament entails difficult struggles between some of the best players from Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, and Vietnam, to promote the relationship between chess players of the countries.

This tournament serves as a promotion for Ouk Chaktrang, the form of chess played in Cambodia. Ouk Chaktrang is a very popular game that can be seen played regularly in Cambodia. Ouk Chaktrang offers a taste of how the game of chess was before pieces got their modern movements, where the game was more slow-paced and methodical, and is plenty of fun in its own right. The game bears resemblance to Makruk and Sittuyin, the chess of Thailand and Myanmar. You can read how to play Ouk Chaktrang in [our rule document](/variants/cambodian).

In addition, this tournament also serves as an introduction to the Ouk Chaktrang tournament in the next year's SEA Games, a biennial sport event of the Southeast Asia region, being held in Cambodia. Some of the participants are confirmed to be participating in the SEA Games as well.

As of today, 30 November 2022, the tournament has concluded. In terms of the individual results, the Cambodian champion [Bora Chheav](/@/CAM_Bora_Chheav) secured the 1st place with his spectacular performance, winning five of his seven games and drawing the other two. Meanwhile, Thailand's Makruk Grandmasters [Worathep Timsri](/@/THA_Worathep_Timsri) and [Warot Kananub](/@/THA_Warot_Kananub) grabbed the 2nd and 3rd place with their amazing skills. However, in terms of team results, Team Thailand, getting the same score as Team Cambodia, has edged the 1st place by number of wins, the first tiebreak.
