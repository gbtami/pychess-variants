We are happy to announce the availability of *three* new variants here on Pychess: [**Dragon Chess**](https://www.pychess.org/variants/dragon), [**Khan's Chess**](https://www.pychess.org/variants/khans), and [**Cannon Shogi**](https://www.pychess.org/variants/cannonshogi)!

[**Dragon Chess**](https://www.pychess.org/variants/dragon) was created by GM Miguel Illescas and it is the simplest fairy piece variant on the site introducing only one new piece the Dragon. It is exactly the same as Hawk in S-Chess or Archbishop in Capablaca chess. You can drop it any time you want to your first rank.

[**Khan's Chess**](https://www.pychess.org/variants/khans) is Couch Tomato's new variant, a successor to Orda Chess with two new pieces in the gold Horde army.

[**Cannon Shogi**](https://www.pychess.org/variants/cannonshogi)  was invented by Peter Michaelsen in February 1998. It introduces orthogonal and diagonal Xiangqi and Janggi cannons to the game. If you like to play Shogi and liked the Quetzal from Chak, you will like this a lot! :)
