[The 1st Dobutsu Tournament](https://lichess.org/team/dobutsu-tournament-pychess) on Pychess is now completed! 
Initially, 16 players signed up for the tournament, but for several reasons, some withdrew, so the two group round-robin ended up with 6-6 players. The field was strong including two titled players [IM @Spinaltap](https://www.pychess.org/@/Spinaltap), [CM @alms](https://www.pychess.org/@/alms), one Dan level Shogi player [@Licetus](https://www.pychess.org/@/Licetus), the former leaderboard #1 [@abunickabhi](https://www.pychess.org/@/abunickabhi) and [three time lichess chess960 shield winner](https://lichess.org/tournament/shields/chess960) [@Tasshaq](https://www.pychess.org/@/Tasshaq).

<h3 align="center">Group Matches</h3>

The tournament started with a Licetus - Tasshaq match in **group A**. Licetus convincingly won 5.5-3.5. These two players seemed to be the strongest there, but [@CyberShredder](https://www.pychess.org/@/CyberShredder) tried to keep up with them. Finally he lost to Tasshaq 6-0 and was not able to qualify for semi finals.

In **group B** IM Spinaltap was the clear favorite. The question was who can gain the second spot. Surprisingly [@Fynmorph](https://www.pychess.org/@/Fynmorph) was able to win against abunickabhi 6-3 and finally managed to overtake him by half a point in the overall standings. Spinaltap, as expected, lost just one point and made it to the semi-finals.
