Alice chess is a chess variant invented in 1953 by V. R. Parton which employs two chessboards rather than one, and a slight (but significant) alteration to the standard rules of chess. The game is named after the main character "Alice" in Lewis Carroll's work Through the Looking-Glass, where transport through the mirror into an alternative world is portrayed on the chessboards by the after-move transfer of chess pieces between boards A and B.

## Rules

- A move must be legal on the board where it is played.
- A piece can only move or capture if the corresponding destination square on the other board is vacant.
- After moving, the piece is transfered to the corresponding square on the other board.

## Clarification

Currently, the en-passant move is not implemented in Alice chess. This may change in the future.
