# ![Placement](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/placement.svg) Placement Chess (Bronstein chess, Pre-Chess, Shuffle-Chess)

Pal Benko credited the idea of “Pre-Chess” or “Shuffle-Chess” to David Bronstein.

Different than the [“Placement Chess”](https://www.chessvariants.org/play/placement-chess) described on the Chess Variants site, this variant is simply a modification where players take turns placing their back rank pieces. Castling only works when the king and the corresponding rook are in their normal position.
