Minishogi is essentially shogi on a 5x5 board. The game was invented (or rediscovered) around 1970 by Shigenobu Kusumoto of Osaka, Japan.

## Rules

As this game is based off shogi, please see the corresponding guide for basic shogi rules first if you are not familiar with them.

The starting setup is as above. Unlike standard shogi, there is no knight or lance. There is only one pawn, a bishhop and rook, and one of each general. Promotion is only done in the last rank. 

## Strategy

Due to the smaller board size, the rook and bishop are not as dominant as standard shogi. However, their promotions are still very much threatening.
