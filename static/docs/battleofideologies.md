# Goals of each army

White's Primary goal (currently the only) is to checkmate the black royal piece.
White focuses on offence; their task is to maul down and strip Black's defences to get through and exploit the colour-bound movement of the Black royal.

The King's ideology is that "**Offence** is the best **Defence**".

Black's Primary goal is to make it so their royal reaches the other side of the board (1st rank). While there also being the option of checkmating White's royal piece in it's palace
Black focuses on defending against White's attack and finding an opening for their royal to reach the other side safely with the help of constant promotions and drops at the start to create walls and exploit White's lack of many leapers.

The Kirin's ideology is that "**Defence** is the best **Offence**".

Stalemate results in a win for the stalemated player. (why not)
