Xiangfu is a Xiangqi variant created by Eventlesstew for the Variant Design Contest.
This essentially aims to be, or was initially going to be, a spiritual successor to Chennis. This variant combines the upfrontness of Marial Arts with the careful aggression of Xiangqi. This is achieved through the Kings always being in the centre and the use of ranging pieces, including the Bishop and the Catapult.

The rules to this variant are the same as Xiangqi, with the following differences:
- Pieces you capture can be dropped within the first two ranks of the board. This is similar to Crazyhouse Xiangqi.
- The palaces on the opposing ends of the board are now combined into a single, large ring, where the Kings are confined to.
- Since each player has two Generals, check and checkmate rules now work like in Spartan Chess. This means that if you have two kings, they can be used on the offensive.

You must capture one general in order to checkmate the other General, unless you can perform a Duple Checkmate!

The pieces move as follows:
RETURNING PIECES:
The following pieces in this variant have the same movement as in Xiangqi.
- Horse
- Chariot
- Cannon

GENERALS
The Generals move 1 space in any direction, like the King from Chess. They are the only pieces confined to the Ring.
Unlike in regular Xiangqi, the opposing Kings can face eachother.

ELEPHANT
The Elephant moves two spaces diagonally, but can move freely since there is no river.
...Yeah, that's the only difference the Elephant has in this variant.

BISHOP
A diagonal variant of the Chariot, the Bishop moves any number of spaces diagonally. This is the same piece as the Bishop from Chess.

CATAPULT
A diagonal variant of the Cannon, The Catapult moves any number of steps diagonally, but must jump over a piece in order to capture. For those who know, this is essentially the Copper Cannon from Cannon Shogi.
