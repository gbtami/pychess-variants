# Antipawns

A hybrid of two variants Antichess and Horde, but with a different starting position gives Antipawns. The ultimate goal of the game is to loose all your pieces like in antichess, but the starting position is different where white and black have 24 pawns each. Also note that the Pawns on the first rank may move two squares, similar to Pawns on the second rank. However, Pawns of the Pieces may not capture Pawns on the first rank that have moved two squares as it is not a valid en passant capture.
