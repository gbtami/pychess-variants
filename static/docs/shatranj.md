Shatranj is an old form of chess, as played in the Sasanian Empire. Its origins are in the Indian game of chaturanga. Modern chess gradually developed from this game, as it was introduced to Europe by contacts in Muslim Al-Andalus (modern Spain) and in Sicily in the 10th century.

## Rules

The general rules are extremely similar to Chess, so this guide will focus on the few differences. The objective is the same: checkmating your opponent's king.

* The kings are placed on the same d file for both players.
* The pawns can't move two squares on the first move. When they reach the eighth rank, they only promote to a ferz.
* Stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player.
* Capturing all one's opponent's pieces apart from the king (baring the king) is a win.

### Ferz

The Ferz moves exactly one square diagonally in any direction. This is much weaker than the Queen in Western Chess.

### Alfil

The Alfil (meaning elephant) moves exactly two squares diagonally in any direction. This is much weaker than the Bishop in Western Chess.
