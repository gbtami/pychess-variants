# ![Capablanca960](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/caparandom.svg) Capablanca 960

Capablanca 960 is a custom variant combining the rules of Capablanca chess with the random placement of Chess 960. The same rules apply to both games. As this is considered a derivative of Capablanca chess, please check the Capablanca chess rules in its separate guide. 960 rules are as below for a reminder.

Note that unlike standard chess, there are more than 960 random positions. The 960 is more of a label than a technical number for this game.

This variant can be played by checking the "Chess960" option when creating a Capablanca chess game.

## 960 Rules

The starting bottom ranks are randomized, but two rules must be followed:

The bishops must be placed on opposite-color squares.
The king must be placed on a square between the rooks.
Castling is the other major rule to take note of. Basically, regardless of where the rooks are, if you castle, the end position will be the same as if the rooks were in standard position.

All other rules are as in Capablanca chess.

## New Pieces

### Archbishop

![Archbishop](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/images/CVariantsGuide/Princesses.png)

Various symbols used for the archbishop. (Note that the hawk is only for Seirawan Chess)

![Archbishop moves](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/images/CVariantsGuide/Archbishop.png)

The archbishop (A) is a compound piece combining the moves of the **bishop** and **knight**. In terms of fairy pieces, this is generically known as the princess, but also has other names in different variants.

The piece is often symbolized with a combination of a knight and bishop; most variants often do not specify how the piece should look otherwise (which is why we offer different piece sets to choose from).

The archbishop is unique in that it is the only piece that can checkmate on its own, which you may be able to appreciate if you look at its movement/attack pattern.

The value of an archbishop is considered slightly better than a rook, but less than the chancellor and queen.

### Chancellor

![Chancellor](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/images/CVariantsGuide/Empresses.png)

Various symbols used for the chancellor. (Note that the elephant is only for Seirawan Chess)

![Chancellor moves](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/images/CVariantsGuide/Chancellor.png)

The chancellor (C) is a compound piece combining the moves of the **rook** and the **knight**. In terms of fairy pieces, this is generically known as the empress, but also has other names in different variants. 

The piece is often symbolized with a combination of a knight and rook; most variants often do not specify how the piece should look otherwise (which is why we offer different piece sets to choose from).

The value of a chancellor is considered better than an archbishop, but equivalent or slightly less than a queen.
