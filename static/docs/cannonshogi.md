Cannon Shogi is a shogi variant. It was invented by Peter Michaelsen in February 1998.

## Rules

A Pawn moves and captures a single square forward or sideways, like the Soldier of Korean Chess. It promotes (optionally) to a Gold General when making a move that begins or ends in the last 3 ranks of the board.

On the 2nd and 8th rank 2x4 cannons are situated. The four cannons of each player are all different.

The diagonal Bishop is flanked by two orthogonal cannons, and the orthogonal Rook is flanked by two diagonal cannons.

The Gold Cannons on d2/f8 move like Rooks, by sliding any number of squares along a row or column, but they can capture an enemy only if there is another piece (of either side) in between. To capture, they leap over the intervening piece and land on the enemy piece, like a cannonball. This is the same move and capture as the Cannon (Pao) of Chinese Chess (Xiangqi).

The Silver Cannons on c2/g8 capture like Gold Cannons, but can only move by leaping over an intervening piece, called a "screen". They move and capture like the Cannon of Korean Chess.

The Copper Cannons on g2/c8 move like Bishops, by sliding any number of squares along a diagonal, but they can capture an enemy only if there is another piece (of either side) in between. They capture by leaping over an intervening piece, and have the same powers as the Cannon of Chinese Chess, but in a diagonal rather than orthogonal direction.

The Iron Cannons on f2/d8 capture like Copper Cannons, but can only move by leaping over a screen. They have the same powers as the Cannon of Korean Chess, but in a diagonal rather than orthogonal direction.

A Cannon promotes (optionally) to a Flying Cannon when making a move that begins or ends in the last 3 ranks. It acquires additional powers:

A Flying Gold Cannon and a Flying Silver Cannon can move orthogonally over whole rows and is able to leap one piece by moving. The FGC and FSC can also move one square diagonally and, besides, move or capture two squares diagonally, by leaping an adjacent piece.

A Flying Copper Cannon and a Flying Iron Cannon can move diagonally over whole rows and is able to leap one piece by moving. The FCC and FIC can also move one square orthogonally and, besides, move or capture two squares orthogonally, by leaping an adjacent piece.

All other pieces move, capture and promote like Shogi pieces. Captured pieces are added to the capturer's "reserve", an army of pieces which can be reintroduced into play on the capturer's side. Like in Shogi, a Knight or Lance may not be dropped on a square from which it will never be able to move. Contrary to Shogi, there are no Pawn drop restrictions: Pawns may be placed on a file that already contains an unpromoted Pawn and may also be dropped with mate.
