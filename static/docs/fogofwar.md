Fog of War is a chess variant invented by Jens Bæk Nielsen and Torben Osted in 1989 under the name of Dark Chess.  A player does not see the entire board – only their own pieces and the squares that they can legally move to.

## Rules

The rules of Fog of War chess are mostly the same as standard chess. The only (and crucial) difference is the absence of checks in this variant. The game only ends when one of the kings is captured.
