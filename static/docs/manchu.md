Manchu chess (Chinese: 满洲棋; pinyin: *Mǎnzhōuqí*), also known as Yitong or Yitong chess (Chinese: 一统棋; pinyin: *Yìtǒngqí*), is an asymmetric variant of Xiangqi. It was created during the Qing Dynasty by the Bannermen and was one of the most popular board games among them.

## Rules

The board and pieces are almost the same as Xiangqi. The black side is unchanged, while the red side loses all its cannons, horses, and chariots except for a single chariot. That chariot combines the moves of the normal chariot, cannon, and horse. This piece is sometimes referred to as the *Banner*.

## Strategy

While black is the stronger side, the black player must be careful not to lose pieces too easily to the banner.
