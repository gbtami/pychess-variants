# Losers Chess

This is basically Antichess with a royal king. Hence, the aim is to get checkmated or lose all pieces except the king. A stalemate is a win for the side which got stalemated. If the king is in check, then removing it from the check is priority. For example, after e4 b5 Bxb5 Nf6 Bxd7, black has to play either of Kxd7/Qxd7/Bxd7/Nbxd7/Nfxd7, and can't play Nxe4. As the aim is to lose all the pieces, this position is in fact lost for black, which it would have been won for black in antichess:

## Opening Traps

As you all may have figured out, most of the opening traps which work in Antichess, don't work here. In fact, the most common opening trap here is after 1.c3, which is a lost opening in antichess.
In this opening trap, after 1. c3 e6 2. a3 Bxa3 3. Rxa3, if black doesn't play one of the moves marked by the blue arrows here, its lost for black:

Assuming black doesn't play one of these moves, then after 4. Rxa7 Rxa7 5. Qa4 Rxa4 6. c4 Rxc4, any of these moves win for white:

as black is forced to play Rxc1 and the king can't move out of check so white wins.
