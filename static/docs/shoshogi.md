# Sho Shogi

_Sho Shogi_ is a historical 9x9 shogi variant. It is very close to standard shogi, but with one key piece difference and no drops.

## Main Differences From Standard Shogi

- No drops and no pockets. Captured pieces are not returned to play.
- Each side has one extra piece: the **drunken elephant**.
- The drunken elephant promotes to the **prince**, which moves like a king.
- After promotion, a side can effectively have two king-like royal pieces (king + prince).

## Starting Position

The starting position is:

lnsgkgsnl/1r2e2b1/ppppppppp/9/9/9/PPPPPPPPP/1B2E2R1/LNSGKGSNL w 0 1
```

Here, `e`/`E` is the drunken elephant.

## Notes

- Movement and promotion for the standard shogi pieces follow normal shogi rules.
- The promoted elephant (prince) is rendered with king artwork in current piece sets.
