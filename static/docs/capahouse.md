## Intro

Capahouse is a custom variant combining the rules of Capablanca chess with the drop rules of Crazyhouse. The same rules apply to both games. As this is considered a derivative of Capablanca chess, please check the Capablanca rules in its separate guide. Crazyhouse rules are as below for a reminder.

## Crazyhouse Rules

Drops can be performed with captured pieces, which would be done in lieu of moving a piece on the board. Drops are annotated with @. So for example,R@e4 means rook drop at e4. The rules for dropping pieces are as follows:

* Drops resulting in immediate checkmate are permitted. Unlike in shogi, this includes pawn drops.
* Pawns may not be dropped on the players' 1st or 8th ranks.
* Pawns that have been promoted and later captured are dropped as pawns.
* Dropped white and black pawns on the 2nd and 7th ranks, respectively, are permitted to make a two-square move as their first move after the drop.
* A dropped rook can't castle.

All other rules are as in Capablanca chess.
