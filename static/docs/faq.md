## Interface

<details><summary>How do I change settings?</summary>

To change the settings, click the gear button in the top right of the screen (next to login or your username) and choose "Board Settings".</details>

Same answer as above, and then click on "Board Settings." All Asian variants have internationalized pieces.</details>

<details><summary>How do I draw arrows and circles on the board?</summary>

Use the right click. Clicking gives you a circle, and dragging gives you an arrow. These are green by default. You can make them red by holding Shift or Ctrl, and you can make them blue by holding Alt.</details>

Those are the time controls for the game. By default we use an increment system. "5+3" means each player has 5 *minutes*, and after each move adds 3 *seconds* to the clock. You can set the time control to be whatever you want when creating the game. The 5+3 is just the default for random mover.</details>
