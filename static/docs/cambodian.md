Cambodian chess, also known as "Ok" (Khmer: អុក) or "Ouk Chatrang" is a variant of Makruk (Thai chess) played in Cambodia.

If you are not familiar with the rules of Makruk, please see that first.

## Rules

The only difference from Makruk is that when no pieces have been captured, the players have the following options:

* on the king's first move, and only if not in check, of moving the king like a knight laterally to the second rank; and
* on the queen's first move, of moving the queen two squares straight ahead (this can leap over an intervening piece)
