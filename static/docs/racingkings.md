# ![RacingKings](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/racingkings.svg) Racing Kings

Race your King to the eighth rank to win.

## Rules
* In this game, checks are entirely forbidden: not only is it forbidden to move one's king into check, but it is also forbidden to check the opponent's king.
* The purpose of the game is to be the first player to move their king to the eighth row. When White moves their king to the eighth row, and Black, immediately on the next move, moves their king to the eighth rank, the game is declared a draw (this rule is to compensate for White's first-move advantage).
* Apart from the above, pieces move and capture exactly as in normal chess.
