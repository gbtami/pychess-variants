# ![ThreeCheck](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/3check.svg) Three-Check

_Check your opponent 3 times to win the game._

## Rules

* All the Laws of FIDE chess apply. In particular, a move is legal if and only if it would have been legal in FIDE chess.
* If you make a legal move that puts your opponent's King into the third check, you win.

## Clarification

The winning move has to be legal, e.g. you can not give the third check while in check. Checkmating your opponent is still a legal way to win.

A move is considered to give ONE check if the King is threatened, regardless if multiple pieces are giving the check (in the event of a double check).
