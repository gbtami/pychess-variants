_Bring your King to the center to win the game._

## Rules

* All the Laws of FIDE chess apply. In particular, a move is legal if and only if it would have been legal in FIDE chess.
* If you legally move your King to one of the center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) you win.

## Clarification

The winning move has to be legal, e.g. you can not move into check. Checkmating your opponent is another legal way to win.
