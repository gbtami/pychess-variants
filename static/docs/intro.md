# Pychess Variants

Many chess variants are available to play here. Available games range from traditional versions of chess played around the world to modern inventions derived from western chess. Each game has something to offer, so please don't hesitate to give each game a try! You can click the links on the left to learn even more about each variant.

## Tips

Each variant also has its own selection of piece sets and boards to choose from! Especially for the Asian variants that use Chinese characters, you can find internationalized pieces for those variants to use as well. To change the settings, click the gear button in the top right of the screen (next to login or your username), choose "Board Settings," and then choose the variant you would like to configure.

If you need to practice with the piece moves and rules before diving into a real game, feel free to select a casual game against the *Random Mover* bot in the lobby.
