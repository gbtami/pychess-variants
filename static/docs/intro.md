# Pychess Variants

Many chess variants are available to play here.  Available games range from traditional versions of chess played around the world to modern inventions derived from western chess. Each game has something to offer, so please don't hesitate to give each game a try! You can click the links on the left to learn even more about each variant.

## Tips

Within the game page, you can also find a link directly to that variant's page by clicking on the variant name itself in the top left box.

Each variant also has its own selection of piece sets and boards to choose from! Especially for the Asian variants that use Chinese characters, you can find internationalized pieces for those variants to use as well. To change the settings, click the gear button in the game replay box on the right. You can also scale the board size using the slider here.
