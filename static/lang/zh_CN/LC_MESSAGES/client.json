    "Later on, developers close to the Lichess project eventually extended Stockfish into Multivariant-Stockfish, in order to support Crazyhouse et al. The father of Fairy-Stockfish, Fabian, is also one of those devs (still) working on that fork, and he later took several steps further in terms of variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was born, so powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project.": "后来，熟悉Lichess项目的开发者最终将Stockfish扩展为Multivariant-Stockfish（即多变体Stockfish），以支持Crazyhouse等。Fairy-Stockfish之父Fabian也是那些（仍然）致力于该多变体Stockfish的开发者之一，而他后来在变体支持和扩展性方面又迈出了几步。就此，Fairy-Stockfish诞生了，其作为建立在Stockfish基础上的项目，是如此的强大。",

Same clean and familiar Lichess look and feel. Plus the power of Stockfish!\"": "最后是我们心爱的pychess-variants，它再次非常聪明地利用了之前大项目的潜在超级力量。其有着同样的线上、实时和竞争的方面；同样干净和熟悉的Lichess外观和感觉；但额外加上了Stockfish的力量！\"",
