    "\"To me, how we've got here today is owing to Stockfish in a BIG way. They rallied global volunteers to come together in the open-source spirit and create such a powerful engine for FREE.

    "Then we've got Lichess to thank. Lichess was also born out of the same open-source spirit, and it too drew in great people as well. Once Lichess incorporated Stockfish as its brains, the rest is history.": "接下來我們還須感謝Lichess。Lichess同樣是開源精神的產物，也同樣吸引了大批人才。自從Lichess將Stockfish作為其思維主腦，剩下的就人盡皆知了。",
    "Lichess enables the online, real-time, and competitive aspects of game-play.

    "Later on, developers close to the Lichess project eventually extended Stockfish into Multivariant-Stockfish, in order to support Crazyhouse et al. The father of Fairy-Stockfish, Fabian, is also one of those devs (still) working on that fork, and he later took several steps further in terms of variant support and extensibility. Thus Fairy-Stockfish was born, so powerful because it builds on the Stockfish project.": "後來，熟悉Lichess項目的開發者最終將Stockfish擴展為Multivariant-Stockfish（即多變體Stockfish），以支持Crazyhouse等。Fairy-Stockfish之父Fabian也是那些（仍然）致力於該多變體Stockfish的開發者之一，而他後來在變體支持和擴展性方面又邁出了幾步。就此，Fairy-Stockfish誕生了，其作為建立在Stockfish基礎上的項目，是如此的強大。",
    "Then comes our beloved pychess-variants, which again very smartly harnesses the underlying superpowers of the big projects. Same online, real-time, and competitive aspects. Same clean and familiar Lichess look and feel. Plus the power of Stockfish!\"": "最後是我們心愛的pychess-variants，它再次非常聰明地利用了之前大項目的潛在超級力量。其有著同樣的線上、實時和競爭的方面；同樣乾淨和熟悉的Lichess外觀和感覺；但額外加上了Stockfish的力量！\"",
